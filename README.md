# learning_Tailwind #1 ðŸ¤ž
Tailwind is one the most popular CSS frameworks that's being used in most of the real time projects in the current scenario hence I am here to explore it for the first time. : ) 

--- 

**Conclusion :**

* Kids use Bootstarp ðŸ‘¶
* Boys use CSS ðŸ‘¦
* Men use SCSS ðŸ§”
* Legends use Tailwind CSS ðŸ˜Ž

*Personally I felt Tailwind is a really amazing tool for everyone especially those who are good at CSS fundamentals. Its neither like Bootstrap which consits for all the things pre-built and non-customisable nor like CSS where we need to like 1000 lines of code for simple flex/grid layout. Its completely optimal and simple to use especially recommended to be used with VS code editor due to its amazing extensions that make our life simple.* 

Happy Codding ðŸš€ðŸ˜Ž ..
