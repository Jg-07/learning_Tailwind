# learning_Tailwind
Tailwind is one the most popular CSS frameworks that's being used in most of the real time projects in the current scenario hence I am here to explore it for the first time. : )

**Conclusion :

* Kids use Bootstarp 👶
* Boys use CSS 👦
* Men use SCSS 🧔‍♂️
* Legends use Tailwind CSS 😎

*Personally I felt Tailwind is really amazing tool for everyone especially those who are good at CSS fundamentals. Its neither like Bootstrap which consits for all the things pre-built and non-customisable nor like CSS where we need to like 1000 lines of code for simple flex/grid layout. Its completely optimal and simple to use especially recommended to be used with VS code due to its amazing extensions then make our life simple. 

Happy Codding 🚀😎 ..
